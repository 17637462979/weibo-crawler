# Weibo Data Crawling

This is the Python implementation of Weibo data crawling (i.e., posted text and images of one specific Weibo user).

The main code is forked from: https://blog.csdn.net/BF02jgtRS00XKtCx/article/details/79547627.

This implementation removes the function of crawling user comments and fixes bugs as well as setting issues.

# Environment

* __Ubuntu 14.04__

# Language

* __Python 3.5.2__

# Running

1. Replace 'XXXX...XXX' of "Cookie" in "headers" with new cookie! (Q?)

2. Empty saving folder (i.e., JuJingyi_Weibo/).

3. Run Python implemented code on Terminal:
```bash
$ python3 WeiboDataCrawling_TextImage.py
```

# Motivation

XDDD
